        <p>
          Fieldist is a prototype platform designed for agencies to manage their
          field marketing business. At the core of the app is a multi-role
          authentication program that conditionally renders the app based on the
          role of the user (admin, brand contact, and field rep).
        </p>
        <p>
          A field rep can view their specific work schedule, check in and out at
          a location, and submit a report. They can edit that report until it is
          approved by an admin.
        </p>
        <p>
          A brand contact is able to view the schedules and data (raw data table
          and metric charts) for events assigned to their brand, as well as
          completed reports once they have been approved by an admin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Admins have the most access in the app. In regard to event reports â€“
          they can approve or deny a report, add comments to support their
          decision, and ultimately give a rating to the report, which can be
          used for internal revue purposes. Additionally, they can view the full
          schedule of events (past, present, and future) and full spread of
          report data (raw data tables and metric charts). Finally, admins have
          full CRUD capabilities for all models in the database.
